# Technocurve ClassicSixteen

## History

Wordpress, in its classic dats, used to ship a new theme every year. The TwentySixteen theme was one of its best. The original ClassicPress shippeds  with a child theme for the TwentySixteen theme. Now that Wordpress has deprecated that theme, the enterprising TradeSouthWest themes have combined the old CP child theme with an updated version of the WP theme, to make ClassicSixteen.

I simply needed to make a couple of personal tweaks, so I made this Technocurve ClassicSixteen as a child theme for the CP theme.
